This is the web based evaluation framework of the BigCloneBench. We adopt the evaluation strategy of BigCloneEval.

The framework is composed of two stage. 1. Detection  2. Evaluation

Detection stage has two phase. To see the source code of 1st phase of detection, go to detection1 branch or go to detection2 branch. To see the code and instrution to use evaluation stage, go to evaluation branch.

Docker image are also created for the framework.
